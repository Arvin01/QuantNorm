# QuantNorm
Quantile Normalization for Batch Effect Removal

Our method aims to effectively cluster the cells by modifying the correlation matrix of cell RNA-seq data by quantile normalization. As can be verified by the dataset below, our method makes a better job classifying cell types for brain data for two batches (human and mouse), compared to ComBat.

# Installation Guide
```{r}
library(devtools)
install_github('tengfei-emory/QuantNorm')
```


# Example 1

The dataset used in this example is downloaded from http://web.stanford.edu/group/barres_lab/brainseq2/brainseq2.html. The data consists of brain RNA-seq measurements for human cells and mouse cells. There are 41 human cell samples and 21 mouse cell samples, the types of which is the column name of the data. For each cell sample, there are 15041 gene counts. The dataset can be loaded by data(humanmouse).

```{r}
library(rgl) #for 3D PCA display

data("humanmouse")

#Numbering the cells by cell types
celltype <- c(rep(1,8),rep(7,6),rep(1,12),rep(2,1),rep(3,5),rep(4,3),rep(5,2),rep(6,4),
              rep(1,2),rep(1,4),rep(2,2),rep(3,6),rep(4,2),rep(5,2),rep(6,3))

#Assigning the batch number that the 62 subjects belonging to.
batches <- c(rep(1,41),rep(2,21))

#Plot the 3D PCA for the uncorrected batch effect data
plot3d(princomp(1-cor(humanmouse,method='spearman'))$scores[,1:3], col=celltype, size=10)

#QuantNorm correction
ccc <- QuantNorm(humanmouse,batches,tol=1e-4)
plot3d(princomp(ccc)$scores[,1:3], col=celltype, size=10)

#ComBat
library(sva) #(may need to install package sva from bioconductor)
cleandat <- ComBat(log(humanmouse+1),batches)
ccc.1<-1-cor(cleandat,method="spearman")
plot3d(princomp(ccc)$scores[,1:3], col=celltype, size=10)
```

# Example 2
The dataset used in this example is reproduced according to Gilad et al (2015). The data contains the normalized counts for 13 different tissues for human and their counterparts in mouse. Our algorithm obtains clusters by tissues. The dataset can be loaded by data(ENCODE.human.mouse).

```{r}
library(pheatmap) #drawing heatmap
data("ENCODE.human.mouse")

#Assigning the batches based on species
batches <- c(rep(1,13),rep(2,13))

#QuantNorm correction
corrected.distrance.matrix <- QuantNorm(ENCODE.human.mouse,batches,method='row/column', cor_method='pearson', logdat=F,standardize = T)
pheatmap(1-corrected.distance.matrix)

#ComBat
library(sva) #(may need to install package sva from bioconductor)
cleandat <- ComBat(ENCODE.human.mouse,batches)
pheatmap(cor(cleandat),clustering_method="average")
```
